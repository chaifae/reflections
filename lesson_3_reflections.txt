When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating, or sharing, or as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you're collaborating and you don't want to have updates from others
    just yet, so you can have more control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is just like a clone, but on Github. You can fork someone's
    repository which creates a copy that you can add and edit. Cloning takes
    an existing repository and makes a copy on your computer. Branches are
    different versions of the same repository, 'branched' off for any multitude
    of reasons, such as experimental changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can compare and merge offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Maybe use something like a shared dropbox folder. But the changes would
    over-write eachother since there can't be difference branches, so that would
    be harder. You wouldn't have to learn how to use Git and Github though, so
    that would be easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Experimental changes that you want feedback on, or really any time you're
    collaborating and want feedback from your partners before updating the main
    branch, master. Directly updating master is easier, there is much less
    hassle involed, but you loose a bit of that collaboration.
